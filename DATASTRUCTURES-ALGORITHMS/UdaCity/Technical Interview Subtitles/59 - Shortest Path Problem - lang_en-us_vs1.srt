00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,473
Hopefully, you've got used to
straight forward titles in computer

2
00:00:03,474 --> 00:00:04,230
science by now.

3
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:08,810
If so, you might be able to guess
that the Shortest Path Problem

4
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:11,440
is all about finding
the shortest path in a graph.

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,990
Early on,
we talked about weighted edges,

6
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:19,900
where the edges in a graph have some
numeric value associated with them.

7
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:22,750
The shortest path is the one where
the sum of the edges is as small

8
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:23,340
as possible.

9
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:26,259
If we had an unweighted graph,

10
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:30,600
the shortest path would just be the one
with the fewest number of edges.

11
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,190
The nature of the solution to this
problem changes a lot depending on

12
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:34,949
the type of graph.

13
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:39,220
For example, the solution to
the Shortest Path Problem for

14
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:44,710
an unweighted graph is actually just
a breath first search, with the BFS,

15
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:49,640
you start at one node and visit
the closest nodes first, slowly moving

16
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,770
out to more distant nodes until you
find the one that you were looking for.

17
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,710
Again, when there's no weights,

18
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:58,840
you just want to find the path
with the least number of edges.
