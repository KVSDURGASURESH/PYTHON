00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:00,940
Hey, there.

2
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:04,820
Welcome to Algorithms and Data
Structures for Technical Interviewing.

3
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:07,950
My name is Brin and
I'll be your guide and mentor.

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:12,500
My job is to teach you how to invent
efficient solutions to unsolved problems

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,700
using algorithms and data structures.

6
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:18,230
A skill you need both in a job and
to get a job.

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,220
Algorithm is a fancy word for

8
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:25,169
something straightforward,
a program that solves a problem.

9
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:29,550
At the start of this course, algorithms
might seem a bit like a magic trick.

10
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:33,922
[SOUND] You see the input to the trick,

11
00:00:33,922 --> 00:00:38,956
and you see the output from the trick.

12
00:00:38,957 --> 00:00:41,750
But everything that happens in
the middle seems pretty mystical.

13
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:46,160
My goal is to teach you the steps
involved with the trick and

14
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,839
to explain what resources you'll
need to pull off the trick.

15
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,850
In this analogy,

16
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:55,630
the resources are often data structures
or a common pattern in the problem.

17
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:00,480
After I've given you all the tools
you'll need, we'll do a little practice

18
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,378
to make sure you're ready to pull off
the tricks and technical interviews.

19
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:08,790
However it's not my intention to
discuss every little detail like

20
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:13,490
the laws of physics or what each tool
is made out of at the molecular level.

21
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,990
You'll be able to apply algorithms
to problems you'll face at work or

22
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:18,429
in an interview.

23
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:20,740
But not use them at the level
of a mathematician.

24
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:26,900
In a real technical interview you just
need to show that you can successfully

25
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,630
perform the trick and that you
understand the concepts behind it.

26
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:33,310
I'm also not trying to
explain every concept

27
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:35,970
that could potentially
show up in an interview.

28
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:40,160
I've designed this course to explain
topics that show up most often, but

29
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:43,900
you should definitely use this
course as a starting place and

30
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:44,460
continue to explore on your own.

31
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,620
I should also note that I'm not
expecting any prior exposure to

32
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,960
algorithms or data structures.

33
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,800
Just having the will to learn.

34
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:57,300
You should have some familiarity
with our programming language and

35
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:00,290
have written some working code
with it before if you want

36
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:04,240
to understand the practice problems
that go along with the videos, but

37
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,589
soon I'll make sure we're on the same
page about exactly what that means.
