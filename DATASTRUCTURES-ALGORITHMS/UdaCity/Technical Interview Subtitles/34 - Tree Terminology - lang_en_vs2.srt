1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,840
Okay, I'm going to throw some
terms at you, get ready.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,680
You can describe a tree
in terms of levels, or

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,879
how many connections it takes
to reach the root plus one.

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:14,570
The root is level 1, and nodes directly
connected to it are on level 2.

5
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:19,640
Nodes in a tree are often described as
having a parent child relationship.

6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:23,480
In this system,
a node at a lower level is a parent, and

7
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,350
the node connected to it at
a higher level is a child.

8
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:29,830
A node in the middle can
be both a parent and

9
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:33,390
a child,
it depends what it's being compared to.

10
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:37,180
Keep in mind though this isn't a real
family tree where children all have two

11
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:38,300
parents.

12
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:41,559
Here, children are only
allowed to have one parent.

13
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,170
If a parent has multiple children,

14
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:46,750
those children are considered
siblings of each other.

15
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:51,800
You can talk about
ancestry in a similar way.

16
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,140
A node at a lower level
can be called an ancestor

17
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:57,480
of a node at a higher level
which is the descendant.

18
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,589
The nodes at the end that don't have
any children are called leaves or

19
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,360
external nodes.

20
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,330
A parent node is called
an internal node.

21
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:08,500
You can call connections edges, and

22
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,820
a group of connections
taken together as a path.

23
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:15,490
The height of a node is the number
of edges between it and

24
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:17,949
the furthest leaf on the tree.

25
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:22,350
A leaf has a height of zero but the
parent of a leaf has a height of one.

26
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:26,289
The height of a tree overall is
just the height of the root node.

27
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:30,990
On the flip side, the depth of a node
is the number of edges to the root.

28
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:33,860
Height and depth should move inversely.

29
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:37,700
If a node is closer to a leaf
then it's further from the root.

30
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,967
[SOUND] Glad that's over with.

31
00:01:39,968 --> 00:01:42,400
Time to learn some more about trees.
