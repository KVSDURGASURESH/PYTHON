00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,000
A list has all the properties
of a collection.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,710
So it has a group of things but
the objects have an order.

3
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:10,950
A shopping list, well not really
something programmers do with a lot,

4
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:14,709
happens to have a lot of the same
properties as the list we use.

5
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:17,700
There are things that might not
have the same type of object, but

6
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,939
they're still related to
everything else on the list.

7
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:22,350
The order doesn't mean much.

8
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:27,210
It's just the order that I ran out of
each item and there's no fixed length.

9
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:30,420
I could just keep adding things
to the end, or adding and

10
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:34,580
removing from the middle and
it doesn't really affect anything.

11
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:37,660
Again, what exactly
the implementation looks like for

12
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:42,100
adding elements will change based on the
language and the type of data structure.

13
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,339
We're still talking theoretically here.

14
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,700
So don't sweat the details too much yet.

15
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:49,910
In this lesson we'll explore
several types of lists.

16
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:52,819
Different programming languages
treat them differently.

17
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:57,630
Sometimes a list is incorporated as a
core feature of a programming language,

18
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:00,190
but what that looks
like can vary wildly.

19
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:04,690
The videos here will talk about the
theoretical concepts that could apply to

20
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:05,230
any language,

21
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:08,910
while the text will explain
the language-specific implementations.
