00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:04,620
In this course, the videos will all
contain explanations in pseudocode.

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,780
But the text will be full of language
specific notes and examples.

3
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,660
I want to briefly go over some of the
basics you should already know before we

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,650
get started with the new material.

5
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:18,560
If any of these things don't sound
familiar to you, please spend some time

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,810
reading about them or
checking out other Udacity courses.

7
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:24,869
If you already know everything just
skim through the information and

8
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:25,870
move on to the next lesson.
