00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,630
There are several different
approaches to DFS and trees.

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:06,560
First, we'll talk about
pre-order traversals.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,930
To me, the pre says,

4
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:13,170
check off a node as you see it before
you traverse any further in the tree.

5
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:16,580
There are other methods of traversal
in which you check off nodes

6
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:18,180
after you've seen their children.

7
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,860
So this rule is really
important to keep in mind.

8
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:24,630
We start at the route and immediately
check off that we've seen it.

9
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,000
Next, we pick one of the children.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,560
Normally the left one by convention,
and check it off too.

11
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,820
We would continue traversing down
the left most nodes until we had a leaf.

12
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:38,840
We check off the leaf and
from there go back up to the parent.

13
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,570
Now we can traverse to the right
child and check it off too.

14
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:45,940
We're done with this subtree, so
we can travel back up to the root and

15
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:47,790
look at its right child.

16
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:51,129
We do the same steps until
we've seen everything.

17
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:52,540
Cool, were done!

18
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:56,140
This might seem intuitive, but
it'll make more sense once we compare it

19
00:00:56,140 --> 00:01:00,170
against a different type of traversal
like an in-order traversal.

20
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:03,750
The trick here is that we're moving
through the nodes in the same order,

21
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:08,230
since this is still a DFS and
we need to explore all children first.

22
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:11,690
However, this time we're going to check
off the nodes in a different order.

23
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:14,970
We're only going to check off a node
when we've seen its left child and

24
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:15,960
come back to it.

25
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,759
All right,
let's see what this looks like.

26
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,560
Again, we start at the root, since
we haven't seen the left child yet.

27
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,100
We have to keep traversing
down until we hit a leaf.

28
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,900
We check off the leaf and
move up to the parent.

29
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,920
Because we've seen the left child
now we can actually check off

30
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,190
the parent this time.

31
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:37,210
We move on to this right node, which has
no children, so we can check it off too.

32
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:38,860
We go back up to the root and

33
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:42,930
repeat all of this on the right
side until we're done.

34
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:44,950
Why is this called in-order?

35
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:47,730
Well, we pretty much went
through the nodes in order

36
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:49,779
from the left most to the right.

37
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:55,520
We had to move up and down a lot, but if
you just look strictly at left to right,

38
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,000
we actually did go through
everything in order.

39
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,750
Lastly, we have
the post-order traversal.

40
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,870
This time we won't be able to
check off a node until we've seen

41
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:09,300
all of its descendants or we visited
both of its children and returned.

42
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,380
Similar steps, we begin at the root,
don't check it off, but

43
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,190
continue down to a leaf.

44
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:18,220
We check off the leaf and
move to the parent.

45
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:20,660
This time we don't check
off the parent though,

46
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,859
we just move on to the right node.

47
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:26,220
Once we've checked off the right child
we can go back up to the parent and

48
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,000
finally check it off too.

49
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,600
Again, we'll skip over the root node and
just move all the way down to the right.

50
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,690
Once everything there is good we can
move back up to the root and get it.
