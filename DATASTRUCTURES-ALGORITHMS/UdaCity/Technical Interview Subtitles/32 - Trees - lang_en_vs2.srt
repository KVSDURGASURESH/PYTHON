00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,900
If there's one thing that you
take away from this course,

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:07,609
it should be that data structures
have rather uncreative names.

3
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:12,860
Trees are data structures that,
well, look like trees.

4
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:19,230
A tree starts from a place called a root
and you add data to it called branches.

5
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,000
A big tree will fan out with lots of
different branches in lots of different

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,640
directions, just like a real tree.

7
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,190
There are plenty of other tree terms
related to these data structures.

8
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:33,860
They have leaves, a collection of
trees is called a forest, etc.

9
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:38,630
Try to keep a straight face as we dive
in and see what trees are all about.
