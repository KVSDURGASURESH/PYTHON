1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,950
Okay, so what does a graph look like?

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:04,420
Wait.
No.

3
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:08,189
I've been conditioned to think of
a graph as a chart that shows trends,

4
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:11,720
like a line graph, or
a graph of a function.

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,860
But that's not what we're
talking about here.

6
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:14,580
Let me try again.

7
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:18,470
Our definition of a graph
looks more like this.

8
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:21,669
The purpose of a graph is to show
how different things are connected

9
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:23,400
to one another.

10
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,790
It's also sometimes called a network.

11
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:28,396
A graph is similar to
a tree in many ways.

12
00:00:28,396 --> 00:00:32,750
For starters, these are called nodes or
vertices, and

13
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:35,415
these lines over here are called edges.

14
00:00:35,415 --> 00:00:39,565
In fact, a tree is just a more
specific type of graph.

15
00:00:39,565 --> 00:00:42,785
It's just like a binary
tree is a type of tree, and

16
00:00:42,785 --> 00:00:45,985
a BST is a type of binary tree.

17
00:00:45,985 --> 00:00:49,785
Here's an example of a valid graph,
where you can really start anywhere and

18
00:00:49,785 --> 00:00:52,735
you'll follow some
path back to the start.

19
00:00:52,735 --> 00:00:55,300
Since cycles like this one are possible,

20
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,669
graphs don't really have
a root node like trees do.

21
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:02,360
Graphs are really vaguely defined,
but we should keep it that way.

22
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,580
As you've probably come to expect,
we need to keep it vague so

23
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,900
our definition will encompass all of
the different use cases for our graph.

24
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,750
For example, I would love to
say that nodes are the parts of

25
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:16,920
graphs that store data, and edges
are just the connections between them.

26
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,940
But, edges can actually store data too.

27
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:23,500
Since graphs can seem really
abstract at the start,

28
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,660
let's make them more
concrete with some examples.

29
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:28,550
Let's imagine this graph
as a social network.

30
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:30,440
This node can be me.

31
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,890
I can draw the rest of
the graph like this.

32
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:35,620
Here, it's clear that nodes are people,
but

33
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:39,850
the edges between the nodes could be
describing any connection between us.

34
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,460
Maybe it's people who've met each other.

35
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:44,919
Here, two notes that
are connected by an edge,

36
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:48,870
sometimes called adjacent,
have met each other in person.

37
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:53,110
This could be a graph of people who've
lived in the same city at the same time,

38
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:55,670
or people who've worked
on a project together.

39
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:57,840
The nodes could contain
any amount of data,

40
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,870
like each person's full name, where
they live now, their birthday, etc.

41
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:06,470
As I said before,
edges could contain data, too.

42
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:10,300
Edges often contain data about
the strength of a connection.

43
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:10,820
For example,

44
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:14,829
these edges could show how many times in
the past week we talked to each other.

45
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:17,590
Okay, let's think about a new example.

46
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:21,300
Let's say this graph is my
travel plans for a big trip.

47
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:25,700
I'm going to fly from San Francisco
to Tokyo, then Kuala Lumpur,

48
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:29,589
then Delhi, then back to KL,
Tokyo, and SF.

49
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:33,110
The edges could contain no information,
or

50
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,510
they could contain how
long the flights are.

51
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:39,299
The information I decide to store will
depend on what I'm using this graph for.
