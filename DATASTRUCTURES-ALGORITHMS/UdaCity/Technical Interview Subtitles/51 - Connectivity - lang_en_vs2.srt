00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,910
Another important property
of graphs is connectivity.

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:08,860
That term has a specific meaning in the
study of graphs called Graph Theory but

3
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:12,870
let's define what it means for
a graph to be connected first.

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:17,160
A disconnected graph has some vertex
that can't be reached by the other

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,640
vertices.

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,860
A disconnected graph might have one
vertex off to the side with no edges.

7
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:27,650
It could also have two
so-called connected components,

8
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:31,310
which are connected graphs on their own
but have no connection between them.

9
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:36,930
Thus, a connected graph has
no disconnected vertices.

10
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:41,290
There's also a metric used to describe
a graph as a whole called connectivity.

11
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,350
Let's look at two different graphs and

12
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:46,880
say they're each describing
a different group of friends.

13
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:49,420
When looking at these two graphs,

14
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:52,960
the one on the right looks like
a much stronger friend group.

15
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,370
There are overall less people but
more connections between them.

16
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:00,750
In the left group I could
remove one connection and

17
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,600
the whole group would be destroyed.

18
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,670
This is the principle
behind connectivity,

19
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:09,610
which measures the minimum number of
elements that need to be removed for

20
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:11,960
a graph to become disconnected.

21
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,890
Depending on the information in
the graph, you can sometimes use

22
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,430
connectivity to answer the question
which graph is stronger.
