00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,600
Literally every time
I hear about stacks,

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:07,470
I can only think about a stack of
pancakes, chocolate chip, of course.

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:10,680
Or maybe I'm just always
thinking about pancakes?

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,350
Not actually sure.

5
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:14,820
Stacks are also list-based
data structures, so

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,500
they have a bit of a different
flair than arrays and linked lists.

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:23,470
The main idea is a stack is like
a stack of objects in real life.

8
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:27,599
You keep putting elements on top and
you have easy access to remove or

9
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,590
look at the top element.

10
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,840
Even if the pancake on the bottom looks
like it has the most chocolate chips

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,630
I can't get to it easily.

12
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:39,390
I need to make my way through
everything above it to reach it.

13
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:43,230
I also know that it was the earliest
thing put on the stack,

14
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,400
back when I thought I would
have chocolate chips to spare.
