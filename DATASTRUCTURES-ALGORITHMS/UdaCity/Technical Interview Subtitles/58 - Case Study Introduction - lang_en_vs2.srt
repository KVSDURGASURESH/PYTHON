00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,800
Congratulations.

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,133
You've learned a lot of tools
to solve computational problems.

3
00:00:05,133 --> 00:00:09,401
Now we're going to dive into some of the
most well-known computational problems,

4
00:00:09,401 --> 00:00:11,700
and see how we can use
our tools to solve them.

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,500
Along the way, we'll look at
a few famous algorithms and

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,170
concepts that show up often
on technical interviews.

7
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:22,120
You might not get asked
specifically to solve one of these

8
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,810
problems in an interview.

9
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:27,680
But it's common to be presented with a
problem that boils down to one of these.

10
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:32,369
Make sure you have a crystal clear
understanding of the root problem.

11
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:36,610
And stay vigilant for instances of
these cases masked as something else.
