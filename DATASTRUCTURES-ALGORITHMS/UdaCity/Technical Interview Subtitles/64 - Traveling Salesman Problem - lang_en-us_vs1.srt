00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,455
The Traveling Salesman Problem or

2
00:00:02,455 --> 00:00:07,100
TSP as it's called, is one of the most
famous problems in computer science.

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,169
Envision a graph where all
of the nodes are cities and

4
00:00:11,169 --> 00:00:13,419
all the edges are roads between them.

5
00:00:13,419 --> 00:00:16,491
TSP asks, what's the fastest way for

6
00:00:16,491 --> 00:00:21,292
our salesman to travel between
every city and return home?

7
00:00:21,292 --> 00:00:25,500
At its essence,
this is an optimization problem.

8
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,360
When you get rid of the analogy and,
I guess,

9
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:33,460
the hat, we have a complicated graph and
we're looking for the optimal route.

10
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:38,780
TSP is used in everything from
microchip design to DNA sequencing.

11
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,260
Let's take a look and see how it's done.
