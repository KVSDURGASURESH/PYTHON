1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:07,130
So I'm taking in a matrix
containing only 0s and 1s.

2
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:09,795
[BLANK_AUDIO]

3
00:00:09,795 --> 00:00:14,400
And what I'm returning is
an integer that represents

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,700
the number of violence in our matrix.

5
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:19,261
[BLANK_AUDIO]

6
00:00:19,261 --> 00:00:21,134
&gt;&gt; Yeah that's perfect really clear.

7
00:00:21,134 --> 00:00:21,919
&gt;&gt; All right thanks.

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,540
&gt;&gt; So that was a short but
important portion of the interview.

9
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:28,930
Can you tell me what
the gentleman was doing?

10
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:31,950
&gt;&gt; Well, it looks like he's confirming
the signature of the algorithm

11
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:33,280
he would be writing.

12
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,990
This step is important because now he
knows what's given in the problem.

13
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:38,350
And what the result needs to be.

14
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:41,600
This is going to be really useful
information once we get into

15
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,330
the next step.

16
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:43,190
In a way,

17
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,900
he's also confirming the question again
to make sure he's on the right track.
