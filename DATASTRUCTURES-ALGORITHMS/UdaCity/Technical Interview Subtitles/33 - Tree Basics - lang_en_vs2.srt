00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,880
Trees have a lot of properties
that make them useful.

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:08,620
However, a tree is really just
an extension of a linked list.

3
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,549
A linked list has one
element at the front and

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,990
a next pointer to another element,
and so on.

5
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:16,980
A tree is similar.

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,900
The first element is called the root.

7
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,930
Instead of having just one next element,
a tree can have several.

8
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:28,150
A linked list is often
drawn horizontally, but

9
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:31,320
a tree is normally drawn
vertically like this.

10
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,200
Just like a linked list, each element
on a tree contains some data.

11
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:41,600
The individual elements in a tree that
contain values are often called nodes.

12
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,430
Let's add a few more constraints
on what we call a tree.

13
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:49,419
First of all,
a tree must be completely connected.

14
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,730
That means,
if you're starting from the root,

15
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:54,470
there must be some way to
reach every node in the tree.

16
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,630
Here is an example of unconnected nodes.

17
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:00,740
So this definitely isn't a tree.

18
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,480
Next, there must not be
any cycles in the tree.

19
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:10,620
A cycle occurs when there's a way for
you to encounter the same node twice.

20
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:14,220
For example, in this tree there
is a connection back to the root.

21
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:18,390
If I start at the root,
then I'll get back to the root.

22
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:20,720
The same goes for this tree.

23
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,500
If you ignore the arrows,
you can still go in a circle.

24
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,729
This counts as a cycle.

25
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:26,500
So beware.
