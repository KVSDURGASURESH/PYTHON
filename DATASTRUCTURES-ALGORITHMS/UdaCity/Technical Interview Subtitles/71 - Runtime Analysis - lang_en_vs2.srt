1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:01,930
Okay, so

2
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:07,141
when I'm looking at every element in
this matrix, I'm looking at least once.

3
00:00:07,142 --> 00:00:10,630
So I'm thinking the runtime
will be n times m,

4
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:15,240
where n is the number of rows and
m is the number of columns.

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,322
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
that sounds like a good analysis.

6
00:00:17,322 --> 00:00:20,600
&gt;&gt; Well, this seems like
the most optimal solution.

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,600
So I think I'm going to jump in and
start coding now

8
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:23,800
&gt;&gt; Awesome let's do it.

9
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:27,680
Hear the interviewee analyze
the steps to his algorithm and

10
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,900
calculated the Big O runtime.

11
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,900
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

12
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,790
This is an important step because
he may realize that his solution is

13
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:39,300
not optimal while analyzing run time but
in this case it actually was optimal.
