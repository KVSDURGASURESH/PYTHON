00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:05,500
As you've seen, graphs are great for
modelling connections between elements.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:09,180
That's wonderful on its own, but graphs
are really powerful because they're so

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,360
easy to traverse based on connections.

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,128
Graph traversal is a lot
like tree traversal.

5
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:20,210
Again, a tree is just a specific
type of graph, so that makes sense.

6
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:24,259
We have two basic methods for traversal.

7
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:28,801
A depth first search, where we follow
one path as far as it'll go, and

8
00:00:28,801 --> 00:00:33,220
a breadth first search, where we look
at all the nodes adjacent to one

9
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:34,860
before moving on to the next level.

10
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:38,820
These traversals
techniques often show up

11
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,600
bundled into more advanced
graph algorithms.

12
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,930
So make sure you understand
them before you move on.
