Hi.

2
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:02,510
I'm back again.

3
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:06,260
Just wanted to stress the importance
of the material you're about to learn.

4
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:08,740
Using a data structure that
employs a hash function,

5
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:11,870
allows you to do look-ups
in constant time.

6
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:13,910
Let that sink in for a second.

7
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:18,140
With everything you've learned so far,
you need to do look-ups in linear time.

8
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:19,810
In a list or a set,

9
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:23,529
you need to look through every element
to find the one you're looking for.

10
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:27,990
Stacks and cues let you look up the
oldest, or newest elements, immediately.

11
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:32,310
And priority queues will let you find
the highest priority element quickly,

12
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:36,850
but if you want any other element,
you've got to do a linear time search.

13
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:38,880
The ability to do
constant time look-ups,

14
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:43,230
will make almost any algorithm
you write, instantly faster.

15
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,610
Everyone here at Udacity
was really excited,

16
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:48,630
that you'd be learning such
a crucial topic today.

17
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:51,310
They all wanted to be
here to talk about it.

18
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:54,680
But they couldn't all
abandon their work, so

19
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:59,170
they decided to send a representative,
whoever was the most excited.

20
00:00:59,170 --> 00:00:59,890
Let's see who they sent.

21
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:08,360
Starbucks says that this concept shows
up constantly in technical interviews.

22
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,830
You can almost always optimize an
answer, or improve an answer with it, or

23
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:15,746
reduce a complex question,
to just use a hash function.

24
00:01:15,746 --> 00:01:18,729
Also, he saw a squirrel this morning.
