Let's talk about maps.

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:06,510
Hm, this wasn't exactly the kind
of map I wanted to talk about, but

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:07,500
it will do for now.

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,190
The defining characteristic of
a map is its key value structure.

5
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:15,800
You can look up where
something is by its key and

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,760
then get whatever is
stored at the value.

7
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:23,900
This is actually pretty similar to
our normal definition of a map.

8
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,670
We can look up something by its name and
then go to a location to get the value.

9
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:32,400
For example,
let's say I wanted to find Winston.

10
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:37,260
I can look him up by his key or
his name to figure out where he is and

11
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,358
then go get him over here.

12
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:42,949
Maps are also called dictionaries for
a similar reason.

13
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:44,810
If you think of a word as a key and

14
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:47,900
the definition as a value,
it's pretty much the same thing.
