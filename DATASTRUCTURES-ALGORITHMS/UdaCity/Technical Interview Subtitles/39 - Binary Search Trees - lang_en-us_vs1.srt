00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,910
Trees inherently aren't
really organized.

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:06,500
When we use a tree, we know what
the overall structure looks like, but

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,860
we don't know where
a specific element will be.

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,719
It turns out that we can add some rules
about the ordering of elements to our

5
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:17,560
trees to accomplish
certain tasks really fast.

6
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,930
In the coming videos,
we'll talk about some common tree types

7
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:24,450
with specific rules regarding
the ordering of elements.

8
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:26,910
As we go, don't let yourself get so

9
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:31,960
caught up in understanding the types of
trees that you forget the big picture.

10
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,140
When would you want to
use these structures?

11
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,290
What tasks would they speed up?

12
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:38,339
What are the pros and
cons of each approach?
