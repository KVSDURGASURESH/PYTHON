This new project that I'm in
charge of really has me stumped.

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:06,350
Do you mind if I think out loud for
a bit Winston?

3
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:09,730
Thanks.

4
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:13,800
I have a ton of data about websites and
I want to be able to search through them

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:18,120
by which pages have links to each other,
there's an issue though.

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,489
I can't get a clear mental picture
of what they would look like and

7
00:00:21,489 --> 00:00:25,726
I don't know which data type is best for
modeling connections between web pages.

00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:29,342
Do you think I should use a graph?

10
00:00:29,342 --> 00:00:30,221
What's that?

12
00:00:33,146 --> 00:00:35,440
Right.

13
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,890
That's a lot of technical mumbo jumbo.

14
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:42,000
But I gather a graph is a data structure
designed to show relationships

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,840
between objects.

16
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,870
Sounds great.

17
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:45,710
I can't wait to learn more.
