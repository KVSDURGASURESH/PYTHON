00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:02,810
Thank you for joining us today.

2
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:04,760
&gt;&gt; Thanks It's a pleasure to be here.

3
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:06,290
&gt;&gt; Let's get started.

4
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,465
So given a 2D matrix,
m, of just 0s and 1s,

5
00:00:09,465 --> 00:00:12,790
count the number of
islands in the matrix.

6
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:17,140
In this case an island is just
a group of 1s or a 1 by itself.

7
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:20,790
&gt;&gt; Okay, so we're given a 2D matrix.

8
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:24,726
Which would look something like this.

9
00:00:24,726 --> 00:00:32,907
[BLANK_AUDIO]

10
00:00:32,907 --> 00:00:36,910
So what we're to do is we're
to find the number of islands.

11
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:39,809
Where an island is
a group of 1s connected.

12
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:44,698
But if 1s are connected diagonally,
does that constitute an island?

13
00:00:44,698 --> 00:00:47,130
&gt;&gt; No, the 1s need to be
connected either horizontally or

14
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,800
vertically to count as an island.

15
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,629
&gt;&gt; Okay, so

16
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:53,690
what we're really supposed to do is find
the number of islands in this matrix.

17
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:57,320
Where an island is 1s connected
horizontally and vertically.

18
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,290
&gt;&gt; That's exactly right.

19
00:00:58,290 --> 00:00:58,790
&gt;&gt; Cool.

20
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,620
&gt;&gt; All right, how do you think
our interview we did for

21
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,620
the first portion of the interview?

22
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:06,750
&gt;&gt; Well I think he didn't do too bad.

23
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:10,410
You clarified the question to make sure
that he's solving the right problem.

24
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:11,140
&gt;&gt; Right.

25
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:13,980
This is a very popular
interview question, so

26
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,890
there are different variations.

27
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:19,140
It's important to make sure you're
solving the right variation.

28
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,790
Some interviewers may consider 1s
connected diagonally to be an island.

29
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:24,520
In general,

30
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:28,369
clarifying a problem is crucial to
being a good software developer.

31
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:31,740
You need to prove to your interviewer
that you won't dive head first into

32
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:32,759
a problem and

33
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:36,260
potentially waste time writing code
that doesn't solve the initial issue.
