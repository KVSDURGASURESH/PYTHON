1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,290
Time to add another type of
data structure to the mix.

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:08,590
Before we dive into maps, I want to
introduce one new concept quickly.

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,480
A set is another one of these broad,
abstract concepts.

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,720
It's comparable to a list.

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:19,360
It's also vaguely a collection of
things, but with one big difference.

6
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,320
A list has some kind of ordering for
its elements.

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,670
A set doesn't have that but instead
doesn't allow for repeated elements.

8
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,380
You can think of a set
kind of like a bag.

9
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:31,788
You can reach in and
pull something out, but

10
00:00:31,788 --> 00:00:35,513
you'll never know what order you're
getting the elements out in.

11
00:00:35,513 --> 00:00:37,821
A map is a set-based data structure,

12
00:00:37,822 --> 00:00:41,160
kind of like an array is
a list-based data structure.

13
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,650
The keys in a map are a set.

14
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:45,620
I know that's a lot of new terminology,
but

15
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,349
let's look at exactly what that means.

16
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:53,530
The keys of a map, like the words
in a dictionary, need to be unique.

17
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:57,620
You can have several definitions for
the same word stored in the value, but

18
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:00,730
if you had the same word in
the dictionary many times,

19
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:04,509
you would randomly pick out a definition
when you were first looking.

20
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:08,700
Thus, each key only
exists once in a map.

21
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,729
And a group of these unique keys
without any order is called a set.

22
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:16,540
So what are maps useful for,
other than dictionaries?

23
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:20,600
You can use a map for
a lot of things that have unique names.

24
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,510
For example, maybe you have a bunch
of information about Udacity courses.

25
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:27,360
You could store each
course ID as a key and

26
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,880
use that to look up more
detailed information as values.
