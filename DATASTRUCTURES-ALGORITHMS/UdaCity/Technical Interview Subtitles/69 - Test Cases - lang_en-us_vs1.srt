1
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:05,905
Okay, so we can also take in
an input of a non object and

2
00:00:05,905 --> 00:00:08,575
maybe even an empty matrix.

3
00:00:08,575 --> 00:00:09,190
Is that right?

4
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:09,979
&gt;&gt; Right.

5
00:00:09,979 --> 00:00:14,400
&gt;&gt; Hm, so we have our regular matrix so
that we're taking in,

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,300
but it contains zeroes and
ones, nothing else, right?

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:18,920
&gt;&gt; That's true.

8
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,915
&gt;&gt; So this is also another
input that we can have.

9
00:00:21,915 --> 00:00:25,490
So here we started thinking
through tests and edge cases for

10
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:27,240
inputs into the algorithm.

11
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,389
As you may have noticed,
when he was creating edge cases,

12
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:32,770
he thought of the possible weird
inputs that he would have to handle.

13
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:36,730
&gt;&gt; Right, if there were other values
that could have been used in his matrix,

14
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:38,819
he would have to account for those.

15
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,201
It's always a good idea to think
about how your code handles null and

16
00:00:42,201 --> 00:00:45,900
empty inputs, since not addressing
them could cause your code to crash.

17
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,765
&gt;&gt; You know what is great about
this step in the approach,

18
00:00:48,765 --> 00:00:51,334
is I have a feeling it
might help in future steps.

19
00:00:51,334 --> 00:00:53,910
&gt;&gt; Let's see.
