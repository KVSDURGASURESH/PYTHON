1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:03,760
Now that you understand algorithms and
data structures,

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,340
it's time to think about
the actual interview.

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:07,400
For this lesson,

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,610
we're joined by a very special
guest to help us to do just that.

5
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:11,350
Welcome, Horatio.

6
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:16,599
&gt;&gt; Hello, I'm Horatio, and
I'm an Android coach here at Udacity.

7
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,420
Not too long ago,

8
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:21,200
I was in a similar situation to
the one you may be in right now.

9
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,270
I never took a class in college about
data structures and algorithms.

10
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:27,740
But I just graduated from
a UDacity Nanodegree, was preparing for

11
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:29,509
technical interviews.

12
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:30,790
Learning about data structures and

13
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:34,490
algorithms made me feel more
confident about technical interviews.

14
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:38,340
But I soon realized what is also very
important is the actual process for

15
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,957
answering an algorithm
question in an interview.

16
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:42,000
&gt;&gt; Definitely.

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,900
When an interviewer asks you a question,
your ability to get the right answer is

18
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,544
just a small part of
what they're evaluating.

19
00:00:48,544 --> 00:00:51,669
They also want to see your
approach to solving problems and

20
00:00:51,669 --> 00:00:53,275
your communication skills.

21
00:00:53,275 --> 00:00:55,510
&gt;&gt; In this lesson,
you'll be shown interviews, and

22
00:00:55,511 --> 00:00:58,787
then we'll break them down at each step
to help you understand exactly what

23
00:00:58,787 --> 00:01:01,480
the interviewee is doing right and
wrong.

24
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,340
Then you will be able to implement
the interviewees' skills while avoiding

25
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:05,760
their mistakes.

26
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,330
&gt;&gt; The path to a successful algorithm's
interview involves a seven-step process,

27
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:13,600
which we'll go over in further
detail throughout the lesson.

28
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,705
&gt;&gt; The steps are Clarifying the
Question, Generating Inputs and Outputs,

29
00:01:18,705 --> 00:01:24,890
Generating Test Cases, Brainstorming,
Runtime Analysis, Coding, and Debugging.

30
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,980
So let's get right into
it with our interview.
