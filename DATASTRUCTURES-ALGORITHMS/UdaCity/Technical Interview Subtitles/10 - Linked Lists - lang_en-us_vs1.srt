00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,890
Hopefully, arrays are starting
to make sense to you.

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:05,689
Let's quickly look at
them in another way.

3
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:08,750
You can think of an array
kind of like this.

4
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:13,640
It's a set of boxes where each
has an address called an index.

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:17,980
This paper chain is more similar to
a construct called a linked list.

6
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:22,600
A linked list is an extension of a list,
but it's definitely not an array.

7
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:27,430
There are still some things that have
order, but there are no indices.

8
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:32,780
Instead, a linked list is characterized,
well, by its links.

9
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:36,770
Each element has some notion of what
the next element is since it's connected

10
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:42,350
to it, but not necessarily how long
the list is or where it is in the list.

11
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:43,960
An array is different.

12
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,700
There is nothing in one
element of the array that says

13
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:48,760
here's your next element.

14
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:52,420
You know what the next element
is by what the next index is.

15
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:55,820
My first thought when I heard this
was why would anybody ever want to

16
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:59,910
use a linked list, an array gives you
more information since you already

17
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:02,900
know where the next element
falls in the array.

18
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,679
However, as we discussed before,
adding and

19
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,590
removing elements from an array
can be really complicated.

20
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:12,960
Adding and removing elements from
a linked list turns out to be so

21
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,949
easy by comparison.

22
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:17,780
You can actually just take
an element out or add one in.

23
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,399
There's only one real quick
consideration here, but

24
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,440
we'll talk about that in a minute.
